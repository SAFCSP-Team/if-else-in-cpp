# If-Else in C++

### Objective

In this project, our main goal is to understand how to use if-else statement in C++.

### Problem

Develop a program that takes an input `number` from the user and prints if that number is an even number or an odd number.


### Implementation
- Write an `if` statement to check if the number given by the user input is an even number.
- If the number is even, print "Even number". Otherwise, print "Odd number".

  
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    /* Your code here*/
    return 0;
}

```
